What we did well:
We completed a lot of user stories and also prioritised fixing any bugs we found before starting a new story, our communication was better than sprint 1 and we also did a lot more testing than sprint 1.

What we can do better:
We will ensure that less user stories are waiting to be finished by unit tests at one time.
